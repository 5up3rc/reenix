# Reenix

This is the start of a unix like operating system written in [Rust].  It is
based on the [Weenix] Operating system written for [Brown's CS167/9].  At the
moment it supports a basic kernel shell, mutiple processes with waitpid, and
writing to disk.  This was written as part of my [CS Senior Thesis]. (To be posted soon).

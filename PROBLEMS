Problems I have had with rust

1) You cannot have statics with heap allocated memory, even if the inital vaient doesn't have it. IE this is illegal:
    static mut abc : Option<Box<int>> = None;
    pub fn main() {
        unsafe { abc = Some(box 4); }
    }

2) All crates must be purely hierarchical. Annoying since sometimes I have something that is logically seperate from other code but it needs at least the fact that a certain type exists to be known. IE the TSD Doesn't need any of the KProc or KThread but it would be nice if it knew how to store a Rc<KProc>.

3) Why does rust optimize out inline asm with -O3!
